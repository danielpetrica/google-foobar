# main points
The main points of this challenge was:
 - create first primes to create a 1000+ string from them 
 - get the corresponding substring for the function input. 
 
 # solution 
 I choosed to generate primes until string lenght is larger than the substring requested by the answer to decrease the processing time and to allow any input. 
 
 The proces is really fast in the 0-10000 rang e wich the project require. It begins to slow down from number near 1000000 because of the primarity test.
